    <h3>Where it Started</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of my studies with Pursuit, one of the administrators suggested to us that we take notes.  She said "I promise you you will learn much more if you write down what you've learned after each class as you progress through each week of the program. I took on doing that through out the year.</p>
    <p>As we approached the end of the year, I decide to make a web site out of the notes I've taken.  This is the result of that effort.</p>
